CS452 Final Project Demo
Lennox Fei

Installation:
pull the latest commit from master, and do "make install" to build a kernel.elf file in the ftfp directory with the given user id

Changes:
A new marklin server was added to account for the CTS quirk appropriately.
Path-finding features a graphMask, allowing individual vertices to be cut from the graph.
There is now a train service, a sensor service and a controller service that coordinate with each other.
Train conductor, which is primarily memory shared, now contains a reservation array and a mutual exclusion system.

TrainService contains logic about reservation, collision detection and path recalculations.
